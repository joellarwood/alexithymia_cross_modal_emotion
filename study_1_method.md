In this study participants will be presented with a cue then a target.

The cue will always be a song that is either happy or sad. These will be 8 cue songs called happy_cue_1, sad_cue_1 ... happy_cue_4, sad_cue_4.  

The target will be either a song, word, or image. There will be 8 target stimuli for each type. These will follow the naming structure below:

The songs will be either happy or sad and follow the naming structure happy_song_target_1, sad_song_target_1 ... happy_song_target_4, sad_song_target_4. Each song will be presented once for each cue song.  

The words will be either `happy` or `sad` and will be presented 4 times each for each cue.

The images will be either happy or sad and follow the naming structure happy_image_1, sad_image_2 ... happy_image_4, sad_image_4. Each image will be presented once for each cue song.

All targets will be presented for 1000ms but participants will have up to 2500ms to respond

This gives 192 trials which should be completely randomised.

There will be a 200ms interval between the cue stimulus and target stimulus with a fixation cross. Between each trial there should be a 1500ms gap. For the first 1000ms a fixation cross should be displayed. For the 500ms following a green fixation cross should be displayed.

For each trial participants need to judge whether the cue and target stimuli have the same emotion. If the emotions match they should press F and if they do not match they should press J.
